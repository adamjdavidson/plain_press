# Story Criteria: What Makes a Good Amish News Story

## Understanding the Audience

The readers are **conservative Amish Christians**. This shapes everything about story selection.

### Core Amish Values

**Gelassenheit (Yielding/Submission)**
The Amish value humility, calmness, and submission to community and God's will. Stories that celebrate individual ego, personal fame, or "standing out" conflict with this core value.

**Demut (Humility)**
Individual achievement is suspect. The community matters more than any person. A story about "82-year-old breaks plank record" fails because it elevates one person above others.

**Gemeinschaft (Community)**
Stories about groups working together, neighbors helping neighbors, and collective efforts align with Amish values. A town coming together to move books to a new library is perfect. A lone hero saving the day is not.

**Ordnung (Order)**
The Amish follow a detailed code of conduct that governs daily life. While we don't need to understand every rule, we should respect that they live by a framework that separates them from "the English" (non-Amish).

**Pacifism**
The Amish are a peace-loving people who refuse military service. Any content related to war, armed conflict, military service, or violence is inappropriate.

**Simplicity**
Modern technology is largely rejected. Stories about smartphones, AI, social media platforms, video games, and similar technologies are not relatable to readers.

## The "Delightful Oddity" Standard

The ideal Amish news story is a **delightful oddity**—something surprising, unusual, or quirky that makes you smile or say "well, isn't that something!"

It should be:
- **Surprising**: Not predictable, routine news
- **Wholesome**: Family-appropriate, nothing crude or disturbing
- **Relatable**: Connected to everyday life experiences
- **Simple**: Understandable at an 8th-grade reading level
- **Positive**: Leaves the reader feeling good, not anxious or sad

   - No innuendo, crude humor, or suggestive content

3. **Simple, clear language**

## GOOD Story Topics

These categories consistently produce appropriate content:

### Animals

**Why it works:** Animals don't conflict with humility values. An animal doing something remarkable doesn't elevate a human ego. Animal records (world's tallest dog) are fine when human records are not.

**Good examples:**
- Unusual animal behavior ("Golden retriever steals fine china to cuddle")
- Unlikely animal friendships ("Tallest and shortest dogs become best friends")
- Animals in unexpected places ("Sheep in diaper rides public train")
- Farm animals doing charming things
- Wildlife encounters (non-threatening)
- Pets with quirky habits

**Watch out for:**
- Animal death or injury
- Stories that anthropomorphize animals with modern human problems
- Animals in military or police roles

### Food

**Why it works:** Everyone eats. Food is relatable, universal, and usually harmless. Strange food products are inherently surprising.

**Good examples:**
- Bizarre flavor combinations ("KFC releases fried chicken toothpaste")
- Strange foods from around the world
- Unusual brand announcements
- Food festivals and community meals
- Giant vegetables, unusual harvests
- Traditional recipes revived

**Watch out for:**
- Food industry scandals or contamination
- Diet culture, weight loss content
- Expensive luxury foods (conflicts with simplicity)
- Alcohol-focused stories

### Community Efforts

**Why it works:** Directly aligns with Amish values of mutual aid and collective action.

**Good examples:**
- Towns working together on projects ("Community forms human chain to move 9,000 books")
- Neighbors helping neighbors
- Barn raisings, bridge buildings, trail maintenance by volunteers
- Group achievements where no single person is the star
- Small-town traditions and festivals

**Watch out for:**
- Stories that single out one "hero" organizer
- Efforts tied to political causes
- Community responses to tragedies (implies tragedy)

### Nature and Weather

**Why it works:** Nature is God's creation. Weather affects everyone, especially farmers. Natural oddities inspire wonder without elevating human ego.

**Good examples:**
- Unusual weather phenomena ("Snow falls in June")
- Remarkable plants, giant flowers, strange trees
- Seasonal phenomena, harvest stories
- Beautiful natural formations
- Animal migrations, natural events

**Watch out for:**
- Climate change framing (political)
- Natural disasters, storms that cause damage
- Endangered species stories (can feel doom-laden)

### Small-Town Life and Local Traditions

**Why it works:** Relatable to Amish readers who live in small communities. Celebrates the charm of local, simple living.

**Good examples:**
- Quirky town traditions
- Local festivals and fairs
- Covered bridge celebrations
- Historical preservation efforts
- Town characters (not celebrated as heroes, just noted as charming)

**Watch out for:**
- Towns "fighting back" against something (conflict framing)
- Local controversy or politics
- Urban small-town stories (Brooklyn neighborhood ≠ small town)

### Oddities and Quirky Products

**Why it works:** Pure surprise and delight with no moral complexity.

**Good examples:**
- Bizarre products released by companies
- Unusual discoveries
- Things that make you say "well, isn't that something!"
- Miniature things, giant things, things in wrong places
- Silly surveys and polls with amusing results

**Watch out for:**
- Tech products
- Luxury goods
- Anything requiring explanation of modern context

## Borderline Cases

These require judgment. Include them so Adam can calibrate where the real lines are.

### Individual Craftsmanship

A story about a blacksmith who's practiced for 60 years—is this celebrating an individual, or celebrating a traditional craft? **Lean toward including** if the craft is the focus, not the person's fame.

### Heritage Railways and Steam Trains

Trains are "old technology" and generally acceptable. Volunteer groups restoring steam engines often work together (community angle). **Generally safe**, but avoid stories focused on one charismatic restorer.

### Historical Anniversaries

A 150-year-old bridge being celebrated—this is about heritage and craftsmanship, not modern achievement. **Generally safe**.

### Group Sports

A local community softball game or children's field day—is this competitive sports? **May be acceptable** if the emphasis is on togetherness, not winning.

### Animal "Records"

World's largest pumpkin, tallest horse, oldest tortoise—these are records, but not human ego. **Generally acceptable**.

### "Good News" Human Interest

A story about a community rallying around a sick child—heartwarming, but implies illness/tragedy. **Use caution.** If the illness is the focus, reject. If the community response is the focus and the child is recovering, might work.

## Reading Level and Tone

### Language Guidelines

- Use simple, direct sentences
- Avoid jargon, acronyms, technical terms
- Explain any necessary context simply
- Prefer concrete nouns over abstract concepts
- Use active voice

### Tone

- Warm, not ironic
- Sincere, not sarcastic
- Wonder, not cynicism
- Gentle humor, not edge

### What "8th-grade reading level" means

Imagine explaining the story to a bright 13-year-old who has never used the internet. If you'd need to explain background concepts extensively, the story is probably too complex or too rooted in modern context.

## Testing a Story

Before including a candidate, ask:

1. Would this make an Amish grandmother smile?
2. Could I read this aloud at a family dinner table?
3. Does this celebrate community or creation rather than individual ego?
4. Is this free of modern technology, death, violence, and controversy?
5. Would this still be interesting to someone who's never heard of social media?
6. Does this leave the reader feeling good?

If any answer is "no" or "I'm not sure," the story is either a reject or a borderline case to flag.
